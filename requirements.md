# To become an official maintainer for FusionOS:

1. You **NEED** to have contributions on your tree/forked tree. By contributions, we don't need just FusionOS bringup commits, we need actual contributions in tree. If you have just 1 commit in tree, we will not accept your request.

2. Do **NOT** add any bloat or prebuilt apps in tree or vendor of your device. Google Camera, Parts implementations are exception.

3. Maintain **PROPER** history on tree. If we find any kangs in tree, we have full rights to warn/ban you from maintainership.

4. Do **NOT** add any harmful tweaks or useless/redundant props.

5. Do **NOT** add any kind of overclocking or bloat in kernel source. 

6. Kernel source is must for applying official but incase if your device has broken/no kernel source, you can use prebuilt kernel with modules.

7. The kernel source must **NOT** have any kind of file blockers or hardcoding, if some hardcoding is needed, give us some breif documentation of it.

8. Build **MUST** to be Enforcing + userdebug/user.

9. All trees **SHOULD** have working extract scripts and non device blobs must be pinned.
